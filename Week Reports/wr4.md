## Basic Terminology

**File system:**  The way files are stored and organized.

**Current directory:** present working directory

**parent directory:** previous directory

**the difference between your home directory and the home directory:** *Your* home directory is the default directory when a user logs in. *The* home directory can be changed.

**pathname:** Indicates the location of the file in the filesystem.

**relative path:** The location of a file starting from the current working directory or a directory that is located inside the current working directory.

**absolute path:** The location of a file starting at the root of the file system.
